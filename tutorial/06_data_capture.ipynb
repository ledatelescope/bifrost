        "This block implements data capture of the [CHIPS format](https://github.com/jaycedowell/bifrost/blob/disk-readers/src/formats/chips.hpp#L36) from the network.  The snippet starts out by creating a socket that will be used to receive the data on using `bifrost.address.Address` and `bifrost.udp_socket.UDPSocket`.  The capture block looks similar to other blocks that we have looked at but there are a few things to note.\n",
        " 1. This block accepts many more keywords than the previous block.  These extra keywords are used to control the packet capture and data ordering when it is copied into the ring buffer.  They are:\n",
        "  * `nsrc` - The number of packet sources to expect data from,\n",
        "  * `src0` - The source ID number for the first packet socket,\n",
        "  * `max_size` - The maximum packet size to accept.  This is usually set to 9000 to allow for jumbo packets,\n",
        "  * `ntime_gulp` - This controls the internal buffer size used by the packet capture.  Bifrost keeps two buffers open and releases them to the output ring as data from new gulps is received.\n",
        "  * `ntime_slot` - The approximate number of packet sets (a packet from all `nsrc` sources) per second.  This is used by Bifrost to determine the boundaries in the gulps.\n",
        " 2. There is a an internal `threading.Event` instance that is used as a signal for telling the `CaptureOp` block to stop.  Without the capture would run indefinitely.\n",
        " 3. There is a `seq_callback` method that is called by Bifrost when the packet sequence changes.  This method accepts a format-specific number of arguments and returns a JSON-packed header that sent to the ring.\n",
        " 4. The `main` method implements the packet capture by calling a collection of Bifrost classes:\n",
        "  * First, a new `PacketCaptureCallback` instance is created and then the callback for the CHIPS format is set to `CaptureOp.seq_callback`.  This redies the method for Bifrost to use it when the sequence changes.\n",
        "  * Next, a new `UDPCapture` instance is created for the packet format with the relevant source/data parameters.  This is used as a context for this packet capture itself.\n",
        "  * Finally, `UDPCapture.recv` is called repeatedly to receive and process packets.  This method returns an integer after a gulp has been released to the ring.  This interger stores the current state of the capture.\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned before, Bifrost also works with reading packets from a file using the `bifrost.packet_capture.DiskReader` class.  This works similar to `UDPCapture` but the packet format specifiers require extra information in order to read packets from disk.  For example, a CHIPS capture of 132 channels is specified as \"chips\" for `UDPCapture` but as \"chips_132\" for `DiskReader`."
