    Args:
        iring (Ring or Block): Input data source.
        space (str): Output data space (e.g., 'cuda' or 'system').
            Default space is same as input.
        *args:  Arguments to ``bifrost.pipeline.TransformBlock``.
        *kwargs: Keyword arguments to ``bifrost.pipeline.TransformBlock``.

    Returns:
        CopyBlock: A new block instance.
