"""
GUPPI Raw format
Headers:
  Records are 80 chars, padded with spaces
  Keywords are truncated/padded with spaces to 8 chars
  "keyword1= <value>"
  String values are enclosed in single-quotes
  Numerical values typically not enclosed in quotes, but sometimes may be
  Final record is always 'END' + ' '*77
Header keywords:
  DIRECTIO: If present and non-zero, headers are padded to a 512-byte boundary
  NBITS:    No. bits per real component (e.g., 4 => 4+4-bit complex values);
              typical values: 8,4,2 (particularly 8)
  BLOCSIZE: No. bytes per binary data block
  OBSNCHAN (or NCHAN?)
  NPOL:     Single-pol if 1 else dual-pol
  OBSFREQ:  Centre freq of data
  OBSBW:    Bandwidth of data (may be negative to indicate high->low channel
              ordering)
  BACKEND:  'GUPPI' for guppi/BL data
  [CHAN_BW]

NTIME = BLOCSIZE * 8 // (2 * NPOL * NCHAN * NBITS)

Binary data:
  [chan][time][pol][complex]
