    """Apply a function to a set of ndarrays.

    Args:
      func_string (str): The function to apply to the arrays, as a string (see
                   below for examples).
      data (dict): Map of string names to ndarrays or scalars.
      axis_names (list): List of string names by which each axis is referenced
                   in func_string.
      shape:       The shape of the computation. If None, the broadcast shape
                   of all data arrays is used.
      func_name (str): Name of the function, for debugging purposes.
      extra_code (str): Additional code to be included at global scope.
      block_shape: The 2D shape of the thread block (y,x) with which the kernel
                   is launched.
                   This is a performance tuning parameter.
                   If NULL, a heuristic is used to select the block shape.
                   Changes to this parameter do _not_ require re-compilation of
                   the kernel.
      block_axes:  List of axis indices (or names) specifying the 2 computation
                   axes to which the thread block (y,x) is mapped.
                   This is a performance tuning parameter.
                   If NULL, a heuristic is used to select the block axes.
                   Values may be negative for reverse indexing.
                   Changes to this parameter _do_ require re-compilation of the
                   kernel.

    Note:
        Only GPU computation is currently supported.
