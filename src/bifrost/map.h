/*! \p bfMap applies a user-defined indexing and transformation function to a
 *     set of arrays.
 *
 *  \param ndim        The number of dimensions of the computation
 *  \param shape       The shape of the computation; an array of length \p ndim
 *  \param axis_names  The name by which each dimension can be referenced; an array of length \p ndim, or NULL
 *  \param narg        The number of BFarrays to operate on
 *  \param args        The BFarrays to operate on; an array of length \p narg
 *  \param arg_names   The names by which each BFarray can be referenced; an array of length \p narg
 *  \param func_name   [optional] Name of the function, for debugging purposes
 *  \param func        The function to apply to the arrays; a string containing executable code
 *  \param extra_code  [optional] A string containing executable code to be included at global scope
 *  \param block_shape The 2D shape of the thread block (y,x) with which the kernel is launched.
 *                       This is a performance tuning parameter.
 *                       If NULL, a heuristic is used to select the block shape.
 *                       Changes to this parameter do _not_ require re-compilation of the kernel.
 *  \param block_axes  The 2 computation axes to which the thread block (y,x) is mapped.
 *                        This is a performance tuning parameter.
 *                        If NULL, a heuristic is used to select the block axes.
 *                        Values may be negative for reverse indexing.
 *                        Changes to this parameter _do_ require re-compilation of the kernel.
 *  \return One of the following error codes: \n
 *  \p BF_STATUS_SUCCESS, \p BF_STATUS_INVALID_SPACE,
 *  \p BF_STATUS_INVALID_POINTER, \p BF_STATUS_INVALID_STRIDE,
 *  \p BF_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED_DTYPE, \p BF_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT,
 *  \p BF_STATUS_DEVICE_ERROR
 *  \note The string \p func must be valid C++11 syntax suitable for execution
 *        as CUDA device code. Examples:\n
 *        \code{.cpp} "c(i,j,k) = a(i,k) + b" // Using axis_names = {"i", "j", "k"}\endcode
 *        \code{.cpp} "z(_) = x(_) * y(_ - y.shape()/2)"    // Using the built-in index array "_"\endcode
 *        \code{.cpp} "out(i) = in((i + shift) % in.shape(0))" // Using the shape of an array\endcode
 *        Broadcasting, negative indexing, and complex math are also supported.
 *  \note Any BFarrays that are immutable, have shape=[1] and are accessible
 *        from system memory are treated as scalars, and must be accessed as,
 *         e.g., "b" not "b(0)".
 *  \note While this function is very flexible, it does not guarantee efficient
 *          computation. E.g., using it for transpose operations is likely to
 *          be much less efficient than using the dedicated bfTranspose function.
